# keylogger
**Keylogger** is a Python-based project designed to capture and log keystrokes. It demonstrates how key-logging can be used for various purposes, such as monitoring typing activity for research, troubleshooting keyboard issues, or learning how keyloggers work for cybersecurity education.
⚠️ **Note**: This project is for **educational purposes only**. Please use responsibly and only on systems you have permission to monitor.

## 🚀 Features

- **Capture Keystrokes**: Records every keystroke made on the keyboard.
- **Logs to File**: Saves keystrokes into a log file for later analysis.
- **Hidden Execution**: Runs in the background without user interference.
- **Modular Design**: Built with functions that can be easily customized or extended.

## 📦 Project Structure

The project contains the following main files:

- **`keylogger.py`** - The main script that initiates the keylogger.
- **`requirements.txt`** - Lists all the Python libraries needed for this project.

---## 🛠️ Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**: Make sure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Git**: (Optional) To clone the repository from GitHub.

### Installation

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/ramprasathmk/keylogger.git
  cd keylogger
```

#### 2. Set Up Virtual Environment

Run this command to create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):

```bash
  python -m venv env
```

#### 3. Activate the Virtual Environment

- Windows:

```bash
  env\Scripts\activate
```

```

#### 4. Install Requirements

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🔍 Usage

Once you've set up the environment, you're ready to run the keylogger.

#### 1. Run the Keylogger

- To start logging keystrokes, run:

```bash
  python keylogger.py
```

#### 2. Check Logs

- Keystrokes are saved in a file (specified within the script). Open this file to view the logged keystrokes.

#### 3. How it works?

- Refer [Code.md](./Code.md)
